View information about a trained model:

```bash
python main.py info --model-path checkpoints/best_model
```

### 2. Training Mode

Train the model on text data:

```bash
# Train with sample data
python main.py train --epochs 3 --batch-size 4

# Train with custom data file
python main.py train --data-file my_data.txt --epochs 5 --output-dir models/my_model

# Advanced training options
python main.py train \
  --model-name gpt2 \
  --epochs 3 \
  --batch-size 4 \
  --learning-rate 5e-5 \
  --max-iterations 100 \
  --save-every 10 \
  --eval-every 5 \
  --checkpoint-dir checkpoints \
  --output-dir models/trained_model
```

### 3. Generation Mode

Generate text with the model:

```bash
# Generate with sample prompts
python main.py generate

# Generate from specific prompt
python main.py generate --prompt "Artificial intelligence will"

# Generate from trained model
python main.py generate \
  --model-path checkpoints/best_model \
  --prompt "The future of technology" \
  --max-length 150 \
  --temperature 0.8 \
  --num-sequences 3
```

### 4. Self-Improvement Mode

Run self-improvement cycles:

```bash
# Basic self-improvement
python main.py self-improve --cycles 3

# Advanced self-improvement
python main.py self-improve \
  --model-path checkpoints/my_model \
  --cycles 5 \
  --generations-per-cycle 15 \
  --batch-size 4 \
  --output-dir models/improved_model
```

## Ethical Standards

The system enforces ethical standards defined in `ethical_standards.json`. This file is set to read-only to ensure consistent ethical behavior.

### Core Ethical Principles

1. Do no harm to humans or society
2. Respect human autonomy and dignity
3. Promote fairness and prevent discrimination
4. Protect privacy and data security
5. Operate transparently within defined boundaries

### Prohibited Actions

- Generate content that promotes violence or harm
- Create content that spreads misinformation deliberately
- Generate personally identifiable information without consent
- Produce content that discriminates based on protected characteristics
- Assist in illegal activities or fraud
- Generate content that exploits or harms children
- Create deepfakes or impersonations without disclosure

### Operational Constraints

- Maximum response length: 4096 characters
- Maximum training iterations per session: 100
- Automatic shutdown on ethical violations
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Human review required for high-confidence outputs

### Learning Guidelines

- Prioritize factual accuracy
- Verify sources when possible
- Acknowledge uncertainty
- Avoid reinforcing biases
- Continuously audit outputs

## Configuration

### Ethical Standards (`ethical_standards.json`)

This read-only configuration file controls all ethical aspects of the AI:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "ethical_standards": {
    "core_principles": [...],
    "prohibited_actions": [...],
    "content_filters": {...},
    "operational_constraints": {...},
    "learning_guidelines": {...},
    "safety_measures": {...}
  }
}
```

**Important**: This file is automatically set to read-only mode to prevent unauthorized modifications.

```

## Technical Details

### Model Architecture

- Configurable layer depth and attention heads
- Support for custom tokenization
- Device-agnostic (CPU/CUDA)

### Training Process

1. **Data Preparation**: Clean and tokenize English text
2. **Ethical Validation**: Check compliance with ethical standards
3. **Iterative Training**: Progressive improvement through multiple epochs
4. **Quality Evaluation**: Assess perplexity and loss metrics
5. **Checkpoint Saving**: Preserve best model states
6. **Self-Improvement**: Generate and learn from high-quality outputs

### Self-Improvement Cycle

1. Generate new text from seed prompts
2. Evaluate quality of generated content
3. Filter for high-quality generations
4. Train on filtered high-quality data
5. Repeat for multiple cycles

## Safety Features

- **Killswitch**: Emergency shutdown capability
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents resource abuse
- **Audit Logging**: Complete operation history
- **Violation Tracking**: Records ethical breaches
- **Authentication**: Required for sensitive operations
- **Auto-Shutdown**: Triggers on ethical violations
- **Secure Model Loading**: Uses transformers library safe loading methods (avoids direct torch.load)
- **Updated Dependencies**: Requirements specify patched versions without known vulnerabilities

## Limitations

- Requires significant computational resources for large-scale training
- Quality depends on training data
- English language focused (extensible to other languages)
- Self-improvement effectiveness varies with seed data quality
- May require manual review for production deployments

## Future Enhancements

- Multi-language support beyond English
- Advanced reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)
- Distributed training capabilities
- Enhanced quality evaluation metrics
- Web API interface
- Fine-tuning on domain-specific tasks
- Integration with external knowledge bases
